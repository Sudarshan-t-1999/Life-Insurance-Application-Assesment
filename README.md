# Life Insurance Application Assesment
The objective of this project is automation of response to applications for a life insurance. The data for this project is available for the kaggle competetion at https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment/overview.
A machine learning model was built with the data from a kaggle competition where the response to a life insurance application is to be predicted.
Since the data is that of real customers of Prudential Life Insurance, it is altered to be anonymous with the response being designated as 1 to 8.
